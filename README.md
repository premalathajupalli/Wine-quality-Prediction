# Wine-quality-Prediction
Aim: The aim is to predict the quality of red and white wines based on their chemical properties using machine learning techniques.

Models Used: We utilized models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, and XGBoost for the prediction task.

Data Preparation: The data is preprocessed and split into training and testing sets for model training and evaluation.

Prediction: After training the models, we use them to predict the quality of wines in the test set and evaluate their performance using metrics like accuracy and confusion matrix.

Model Saving: The best-performing model is saved for future use to make quality predictions without retraining.
